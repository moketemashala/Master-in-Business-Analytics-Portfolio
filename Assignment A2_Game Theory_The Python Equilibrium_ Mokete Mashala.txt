WELCOME TO THE GAME {user_name.upper()}. It's a pleasure to meet you.
{"*"*100}
Here is an overview of the situation:

TThe game involves the entry of a new company (i.e., entrant) into a lucrative market. Currently, 
there is already an established monopolist company (i.e., incumbent) with 100% market share. 
Assume that there is a set total market size for a product that is a necessity which is not
affected by the price levels of the players. The relative market share of each player depends 
on the prices chosen. This will dictate how much profit they each make. 

The price options, market share and profit are shown below and already account marginal costs of 
production, assuming there are no fixed costs. In the case of the entrant, if the company enters 
the market at a high price while the incumbent sells at a low price, there is no incentive for 
customers to shift to the entrant’s product. 
Henceforth, the entrant will not gain any market share, nor make any profits.

The incumbent will lose 40% of the market share if it sells at a higher price 
than the entrant, as consumers will want to shift to buy cheaper products from the entrant.

YOU, {user_name.upper()} represent the entrant. 
You will compete against an incumbent company. You must choose the selling price.
To win you must obtain the maximum market share of 40% and earn $1800 in profits. 
The incumbent will win if it obtains 100% market share with profits of $4000.

If you do well, perhaps this may be the beginning of something great!!! 

Note I=Incumbent, E=Entrant({user_name})

All the best!

Here is an overview of the situation:You are a new Entrant into a lucrative market in Boston. 
You will compete against an Incumbent company who has a very strong market share.
You have to choose the selling price of your product.
Depending on the price you choose, you will be able to maximize your profits and gain market share.
Your goal is to maximize your profits by gaining the highest market share.
If you do well, perhaps this may be the beggining of something great!!! Note I=Incumbent, E=Entrant({user_name})
